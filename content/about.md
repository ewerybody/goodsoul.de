Hello, my name is Eric (aka ëRiC or ewerybody) from Laniakea Supercluster, Milky Way Galaxy, 3rd planet of the "Sun" system and this is my website/blog for personal ramblings, collections of random stuff I come across and aaaaaall the projects I want to do and maybe even am doing already.

### Who am I?

**Professionally** - I was a **Special Effects-** and **Technical Artist** for 24 years [on about 30 video game titles](https://www.mobygames.com/person/126735/eric-werner/credits/) until 2025. My last position was **Principal Technical Artist** at [Crytek](https://crytek.com) for 13 years in Frankfurt am Main, Germany.\
"Technical Artist" **What is that?** Here is a pretty comprehensive [video from Riot Games on YouTube about techart](https://youtu.be/kr7XYXMM7-U). So, that might be a lot of things already and frankly it is! I __used__ to do effects and had a kind of catch phrase like "fire, water, smoke, magic, explosions, butterflies" to outline what it's about. But that evolved over destruction simulation, scripting add-ons for 3D tools into full time tool & pipeline programming. Mainly with Python and Qt.

**Privately** - I'm a tinkerer at heart. Since coding is the ultimate tinkering on the computer I do a bit of that but also do 2D, 3D and vector graphics. I’m also into DJing and producing electronic music of the style (deep, jazz, brazil, vocal, tech-) House, Breakbeats, Swing/Jazz and easy listening breaks for many many years now. I did music as well drumming in Berlin in the samba groups drumkitchen and Sussurro do Asfalto. Furthermore I did a bit of [demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene) stuff for the group [Brain Control](https://braincontrol.org).

Teaching beginners how to swing dance or how to code was pretty exciting as well! And I'm looking forward doing more like that somewhen.

### What's this about?

As I'm interested in all these things space, FOSS, streetart, cycling, sketching, cooking, society, music, language, technology there might eventually be a bit or more about any of these topics. I'll try to make it semantically accessible via [tags](/tags). Thanks for reading so far! Much appreciated! ☺️
