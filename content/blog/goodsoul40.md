Yes, this is already the 4th installment of this website. And it's been 23 years since it all started! üòÆ
Emojis were not a thing already and like them almost any fancy looks had to be hacked together with gifs. Darn, even transparency was a problem and dedicated hacks for certain browsers (well, Internet Explorer mostly) were pretty common.

After all this time I am not even a web-geek! I know .. ehmm, better I can teach myself what I need to know for the problem in front of me in the moment and forget about it asap. So this here is my little experience with it :]

### a **little** timeline

1. `2001-2006` ‚Ä¢ hand crafted HTML frame jungle as a 'DJ friends calendar page' with "blog" notes.\
2. `2007-2008` ‚Ä¢ [Movable Type](https://movabletype.org) php blog thing.
3. `2008-2023` ‚Ä¢ [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org) with tailored design (which broke somewhen, ).
4. `2024-...` ‚Ä¢ Staticly generated from md-files with [Zola](https://getzola.org).

### Why **now** Zola?

ü§∑ I don't know. First off, there was no way it would have been anything else than **static**. I have some experience with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) now. It's alright. I don't love the documentation. But guess [I'm not alone there](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30527884).

After spending some time with it now: [the Zola-Docs](https://getzola.org/documentation/content/section/) aren't uber great either. For once I think the VS Code tooling for HUGO came a long way and Zola might be behind. I mean if the IDE helps you with most of the things you might not need to look up website-documentation at all!

For more there is [Tera](https://keats.github.io/tera/) ... eh whut now?! üßê Well, Zola is built upon it. And **you need to know that**! Otherwise you end up scratching your head why there is no info in the Zola docs about simple things such as [for loops](https://keats.github.io/tera/docs/#for)

They have actually real good working things!
