Yes, this is already the 4th installment of this website. And it's been 23 years since it all started! ðŸ˜®
Emojis were not a thing already and like them almost any fancy looks had to be hacked together with gifs. Darn, even transparency was a problem and dedicated hacks for certain browsers (well, Internet Explorer mostly) were pretty common.

After all this time I am not even a web-geek! I know .. ehmm, better I can teach myself what I need to know for the problem in front of me in the moment and forget about it asap. So this here is my little experience with it :]

### a **little** timeline

1. `2001-2006` â€¢ hand crafted HTML frame jungle as a 'DJ friends calendar page' with "blog" notes.\
2. `2007-2008` â€¢ [Movable Type](https://movabletype.org) php blog thing.
3. `2008-2023` â€¢ [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org) with tailored design (which broke somewhen, ).
4. `2024-...` â€¢ Staticly generated from md-files with [Zola](https://getzola.org).

### Why **now** Zola?

ðŸ¤· I don't know. First off, there was no way it would have been anything else than **static**. I have some experience with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) now. It's alright. I kinda hate the documentation. ...
